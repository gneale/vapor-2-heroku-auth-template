This repo is a `vapor-2` (a `swift` framework) app template with auth routes, and it's ready to be deployed to `Heroku`
<br><br><br>

## Features

* Heroku / postgres ready
* `HTTPS` only, `HTTP` requests are rejected
* Script for quick change of crypto.json keys

## What's included

#### Public routes:

* `GET` `/`, `/hello`, `/hello/name`
* * hello routes for quick tests
* `wss://host/ws`
* * a websocket connection, will reverse and return whatever you send it

#### Auth routes:

* `POST` /register 
* * send `username` and `password` as form-data
* `POST` /login 
* * send credentials as HTTP basic auth
* `POST` /logout
* * auth protected, removes token

#### Token protected:

* `GET` /me 
* * will return current username
* `GET` /users
* * will return list of all users (except for the one making the request)

## Deploy

There's an option to use `vapor toolbelt`, but I prefer to do this manually:

* prepare heroku app
* * create app
* * add postgres database
* * settings - add vapor buildpack: https://github.com/vapor-community/heroku-buildpack
* `git clone https://github.com/truemetal/vapor-2-heroku-auth-template.git` to your mac
* generate crypto keys by running `./crypto.sh`
* `git remote add heroku <your heroku app url>`
* `git push heroku master`

##### and to move it to your github / bitbucket 

* `git remote rm origin`
* `git remote add origin <your repo path>`
